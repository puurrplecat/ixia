# ixia

Ixia is a student project and is a simple programming langauge that is translated to C, (so to not worry about actual compilation at the moment), then 
compiled by mature compilers such as GCC. Ixia will primarily have a more statistical focus, however will remain a turing complete general purpose programming langauge. It is high level and terse, yet if the programmer desires a finer control they can opt to use pointers.
